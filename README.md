# gr12_badminton_league
This is my final project for my Grade 12 ISU. It is a badminton league management system created for TDSB.

To install:

1. Upload to a web server.
2. Create a database in MySQL to store the data.
3. Run install.php and enter the database information.
4. Delete install.php.
5. You can now log in using the adminstrator password you entered in step 3.
